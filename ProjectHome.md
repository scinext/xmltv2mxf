Should allow the import of standard xmltv files into Windows 7 media center via loadMXF.exe for 3rd party EPG.  It is also reported that this works with Windows Vista+TV Pack, although this is not it's intended purpose.

This is a Visual Studio 2008 Express project, a c# WPF/Console app for .net v3.5
Contributers welcome.

At this stage, it has been tested specifically for "xmltvnz" files, but should be able to cope with all xmltv files.

Very basic at this stage, we will keep an eye on what Microsoft does between the public Beta and the released version of Windows 7.
